					You fit into a bigger context than you probably think.

					Our past has created our present.  How we are interconnected with our ancestors, all the way down to our parents, is a 
					fascinating area of study.  But have you ever wondered how all of our ancestors may have been related to each other?
			
					</br></br>	
					We aren't just talking about blood relations, or relations by marriage, but relationships founded on geography, neighborhoods, 
					businesses, travels and travails shared by people of a community.
						</br></br>	
					As a member, you are able to access all of the data in our archives that directly and indirectly relate to you who are. With 
					a better understanding of our past, we can have a tighter grasp on who we may become in the future.
