					<span class="overlay-subtitles">How advertising and Sponsored Stories work</span></br></br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Advertising</span></br>
							We do not share any of your information with advertisers (unless, of course, you give us permission). As described in this policy, we may share your information when 
							we have removed from it anything that personally identifies you or combined it with other information so that it no longer personally identifies you.
							We use the information we receive to deliver ads and to make them more relevant to you. This includes all of the things you share and do on Book of Relations, 
							such as the postings likes or key words from your stories, and the things we infer from your use of Book of Relations. If the advertiser chooses to run the ad 
							(also known as placing the order), we serve the ad to people who meet the criteria the advertiser selected, but we do not tell the advertiser who any of those people are. 
							So, for example, if a person views or otherwise interacts with the ad, the advertiser might infer that the person is a 50-to-65-year-old man who lives in the U.S. and 
							likes football. But we would not tell the advertiser who that person is. After the ad runs, we provide advertisers with reports on how their ads performed. For example 
							we give advertisers reports telling them how many users saw or clicked on their ads. But these reports are anonymous. We do not tell advertisers who saw or clicked on 
							their ads. Advertisers sometimes place cookies on your computer in order to make their ads more effective.</br></br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Advertising and Context</span></br>
							Book of Relations Ads are sometimes paired with stories that you or your relations have posted. For example, an ad for a car company may be paired with a story that you 
							or a relation posted on a Book of Relations page that includes that brand of car.</br></br>
							This is the same type of news story that could show up in your News Feed, only we place it next to a paid advertisement to make that ad more relevant and interesting.
							When you show up in one of these news stories, we will only pair it with ads shown to your friends. If you do not want to appear in stories paired with Book of Relations 
							Ads, you can opt out using your Edit social ads setting.Learn what happens when you click "Like" on an advertisement or an advertiser's Book of Relations Page.
							We may serve ads, including those with social context (or serve just social context), on other sites. These work just like the ads we serve on Book of Relations - the 
							advertisers do not receive any of your information. Only people that could see the Book of Relations action (like on your timeline) would see it paired in this way.
							Your Show my social actions in Book of Relations Ads setting only controls ads with social context. It does not control Sponsored Stories, ads or information about 
							Book of Relations's services and features, or other Book of Relations content. Games, applications and websites can serve ads directly to you or help us serve ads to 
							you or others if they have information like your User ID or email address.</br></br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Sponsoring Posts or Events</span></br>
							Many of the things you do on Book of Relations (like "liking" a Page) are posted on Book of Relations and shared in the site's Feed. But there's a lot to read in Feed. 
							That's why we allow people to "sponsor" your stories to make sure your friends see them. For example, if you RSVP to an event hosted by a local restaurant, that 
							restaurant may want to make sure your friends see it so they can come too. If they do sponsor a story, that story will appear in the same place ads usually do or 
							in your News Feed under the heading "Sponsored" or something similar. Only people that could originally see the story can see the sponsored story, and no personal 
							information about you (or your friends) is shared with the sponsor. Your Show my social actions in Book of Relations Ads setting only controls ads with social context. 
							It does not control Sponsored Stories, ads or information about Book of Relations's services and features, or other Book of Relations content.</br></br>
					
					<!-- <span class="overlay-subtitles">Book of Relations content</span></br>
						We like to tell you about some of the features and tools your friends and others use on Book of Relations, to help you have a better experience. For example, if your 
						friend uses our friend finder tool to find more friends on Book of Relations, we may tell you about it to encourage you to use it as well. This of course means your 
						friend may similarly see suggestions based on the things you do. But we will try to only show it to friends that could benefit from your experience.
						Your Show my social actions in Book of Relations Ads setting only controls ads with social context. It does not control Sponsored Stories, ads or information about 
						Book of Relations's services and features, or other Book of Relations content. -->
					</br></br>

					<span class="overlay-subtitles">Information About You</span></br>
						We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:</br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Your information</span></br>
							Your information is the information that's required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.</br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Registration information</span></br>
							When you sign up for Book of Relations, you are required to provide your name, email address, birthday, and gender.</br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Information shared</span></br>
							Your information also includes the information you choose to share on Book of Relations, such as when you post a status update, upload a photo, or comment on a 
							friend's story includes the information you choose to share when you take an action, such as when you add a friend, like a Page or a website, add a place to your story, 
							find relations using our contact importers, or indicate you are in a relationship. Your name, profile pictures, avatar, gender, networks, username and User 
							ID are treated just like information you choose to make public. Your birthday allows us to do things like show you age-appropriate content and 
							advertisements.</br></br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Information others post about you</span></br>
							We receive information about you from your relations and others, such as when they upload your contact information, post a photo of you, add you to a story, 
							tag you in a photo or status update, add you to a location or event, or add you to a group. When people use Book of Relations, they may store and share information 
							about you and others that they have, such as when they upload and manage their invites and contacts.</br></br>
					
					<span class="overlay-subtitles">Other information we receive about you</span></br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">We also receive other types of information about you:</span></br>
							We receive data about you whenever you interact with Book of Relations, such as when you look at another person's postings or story, send or receive a message, search for 
							a friend or a Page, click on, view or otherwise interact with things, or make other purchases through Book of Relations. When you post things like photos or videos 
							on Book of Relations, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.
							We receive data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access Book of Relations, including when multiple users log in from the same device. 
							This may include your IP address and other information about things like your internet service, location, the type (including identifiers) of browser you use, or 
							the pages you visit. For example, we may get your GPS or other location information so we can tell you if any of your relations are nearby.
							We receive data whenever you visit a game, application, or website that uses Book of Relations Platform or visit a site with a Book of Relations feature 
							(such as a social plugin), sometimes through cookies. This may include the date and time you visit the site; the web address, or URL, you're on; technical information 
							about the IP address, browser and the operating system you use; and, if you are logged in to Book of Relations, your User ID.
							Sometimes we get data from our advertising partners, customers and other third parties that help us (or them) deliver ads, understand online activity, and generally 
							make Book of Relations better. For example, an advertiser may tell us information about you (like how you responded to an ad on Book of Relations or on another site) 
							in order to measure the effectiveness of - and improve the quality of - ads. We also put together data from the information we already have about you and your relations. 
							For example, we may put together data about you to determine which relations we should show you in your News Feed or suggest you tag in the photos you post. We may 
							put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example, tell you and your relations about people or events nearby, 
							or offer deals to you that you might be interested in. We may also put together data about you to serve you ads that might be more relevant to you.
							When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it until it is no longer 
							useful to provide you services, like keeping your last GPS coordinates to send you relevant notifications. We only provide data to our advertising partners or 
							customers after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it 
							is no longer associated with you.</br></br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Public information</span></br>
							When we use the phrase "public information", we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available.</br>
							Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off of Book of Relations, will be able to see it. Choosing 
							to make your information public also means that this information: can be associated with you (i.e., your name, avatars, photos, postings, User ID, 
							username, etc.) even off Book of Relations; can show up when someone does a search on Book of Relations or on a public search engine;
							will be accessible to the Book of Relations-integrated games, applications, and websites you and your relations use; and
							Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something. This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, 
							you should assume the information that you post will be publicly available. When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.</br></br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Information that is always publicly available</span></br>
							The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public.</br>
							<span class="overlay-subtitles">Name</span></br>
							This helps your relations and family find you.</br>
							<span class="overlay-subtitles">Profile Avatars and Photos</span></br>
							These help your relations and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making any of these photos public, you can always delete it. Unless you delete them, 
							when you add a new profile picture or photo, the previous photo will remain public in your album.</br>
							<span class="overlay-subtitles">Gender</span></br>
							This allows us to refer to you properly.</br>
							<span class="overlay-subtitles">Username and User ID</span></br>
							These allow you to give out a custom link to your postings or Page. receive email at your email address, and help make Book of Relations possible.
							<span class="overlay-subtitles">Stories</span></br>
							Any story that is submitted for publication to Book of Relations is posted in a public forem for people to view and read. This is user added content and the basis 
							of what Book of Relations is built, and we take no responsibility to the historical accuracy of this information. It is the user's perception of this event or
							story and is published with this understanding.</br>
							<span class="overlay-subtitles">Family Trees</span></br>
							Family trees are GEDCOM files or variations of data entered by users and therefore are handled in such a manner that the user is responsible for the accuracy
							of the family tree (genealogy) information submitted including people's names, dates of events, relationships, and any other data the file includes. 
							Book of Relations holds no responsibility to the accuracy of this data and is therefore only the publishing entity of this information and once submitted 
							becomes the property of Book of Relations, which is then used in the database to add the historical content to the site and will be used in that manner for
							public research information.
							</br></br>
					
					<span class="overlay-subtitles">Usernames and IDs</span></br>
						A Username (or Book of Relations URL) is a custom link to your postings that you can give out to people. Usernames appear in the URL on your postings. We also use 
						your User ID to identify your Book of Relations account. If someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information about you through the Book of 
						Relations.com website. For example, if someone has your Username, they can type BookofRelations.com/members/Username into their browser and see your public information 
						as well as anything else you've let them see. Similarly, someone with your Username or User ID can access information about you and post to your account. 
						Specifically, they can access your public information, along with your age range, country, and any other information considered public information.</br></br>
					
					<span class="overlay-subtitles">How we use the information received</span></br>
						We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your relations, our partners, 
						the advertisers that purchase ads on the site. For example, we may use the information we receive about you: as part of our efforts to keep Book of Relations 
						products, services and integrations safe and secure; to protect Book of Relations’ or others' rights or property; to provide you with location features and 
						services, like telling you and your relations when something is going on nearby; to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see, including 
						to deliver relevant ads to you; for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.
						Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide Book of Relations as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and 
						services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways. All posts, stories, family history, events, or other information given 
						to aid in the content and relations within Book of Relations is considered Book of Relations property.</br></br>
					
					<span class="overlay-subtitles">Deactivating or deleting account</span></br>
						If you want to stop using your account, you can either deactivate or delete it.</br>
						<span class="overlay-subtitles">Deactivate</span></br>
							Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. We do not delete any of your information including stories, family history information or other data which 
							can be used by Book of Relations for content. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to 
							reactivate your account at some point in the future. You can deactivate your account on your account settings page. Your relations will still see you listed in 
							their list of relations while your account is deactivated. See Membership Info to for links to deactivate your account.</br>
							<span class="overlay-subtitles">Deletion</span></br>
							When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Book of Relations. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but information 
							may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it.
							Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some of the things you do on 
							Book of Relations aren't stored in your account, like posting to a group or sending someone a message (where your friend may still have a message you sent, 
							even after you delete your account). That information remains after you delete your account.</br>
